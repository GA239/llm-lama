Note: If you are using Apple Silicon (M1) Mac, make sure you have installed a version of Python that supports arm64 architecture. For example:
```bash
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh

```
Otherwise, while installing it will build the llama.ccp x86 version which will be 10x slower on Apple Silicon (M1) Mac.
